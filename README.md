## 🚀 Getting Started

### What You'll Need

- A Discord server where you have admin permissions
- A free Supabase account (for storing your data)
- About 10 minutes to set everything up

### Step 1: Set Up Your Bot

1. **Download the bot files**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/discord-rsvp-bot.git
   cd discord-rsvp-bot
   ```

2. **Install the required software**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Create your configuration file**
   
   Create a file called `.env` in the bot folder and add:
   ```env
   DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
   SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
   ```

### Step 2: Set Up Your Database (Supabase)

1. **Create a free Supabase account**
   - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and sign up
   - Create a new project

2. **Set up your database tables**
   - In your Supabase dashboard, go to "SQL Editor"
   - Copy and paste the contents of `database_schemas/supabase_schema.sql`
   - Click "Run" to create the tables
   - Do the same for the other migration files in the `database_schemas` folder

3. **Get your connection details**
   - Go to Settings → API in your Supabase dashboard
   - Copy the "Project URL" and "anon public" key
   - Put these in your `.env` file

### Step 3: Add the Bot to Your Server

1. **Invite the bot** to your Discord server with these permissions:
   - Send Messages
   - Use Slash Commands
   - Manage Messages (required for deleting previous posts)
   - View Members
   - Embed Links

2. **Start the bot**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 🎮 Setting Up Your Events

### Invite to Server

URL: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1388283299562262559&permissions=1144344644123728&integration_type=0&scope=bot

### First Time Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Create your weekly schedule**
   ```
   /setup_weekly_schedule
   ```
   The bot will ask you about each day of the week. For each day, tell it:
   - What the event is called (like "Raid Night" or "Training")
   - What gear/outfit people need
   - What vehicle they should bring

2. **Choose where events will be posted**
   ```
   /set_event_channel #your-events-channel
   ```
   Pick the channel where you want daily event announcements to appear.

3. **Set your event time**
   ```
   /set_event_time hour:20 minute:0
   ```
   This example sets events to start at 8:00 PM Eastern Time.

4. **Set when daily posts appear** (optional)
   ```
   /set_posting_time hour:9 minute:0
   ```
   This sets when the daily RSVP posts are created (default is 9:00 AM Eastern).

5. **Turn on reminders**
   ```
   /configure_reminders enabled:true four_pm:true one_hour:true fifteen_minutes:true
   ```
   This sends reminders at 4 PM, 1 hour before, and 15 minutes before events.

5. **View and edit your schedule** (optional)
   ```
   /view_schedule
   ```
   See your complete weekly schedule. Use `/edit_event [day]` to modify any event.

### Example Weekly Schedule

Here's what a typical setup might look like:

- **Monday**: "Raid Night" | Combat Gear | Tank
- **Tuesday**: "PvP Tournament" | Light Armor | Fast Car  
- **Wednesday**: "Training Session" | Practice Gear | Motorcycle
- **Thursday**: "Casual Night" | Comfortable Clothes | Any Vehicle
- **Friday**: "Weekend Prep" | Weekend Gear | SUV
