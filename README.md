## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Environment variable not set" error:**
- Ensure your `.env` file is in the root directory
- Check that environment variables are properly set on your hosting platform

**Database connection errors:**
- Verify your Supabase URL and API key are correct
- Ensure your Supabase project is active and accessible
- Check that all migration files have been applied in the SQL Editor
- Make sure Row Level Security (RLS) policies are configured correctly

**Bot not responding to commands:**
- Verify the bot has proper permissions in your Discord server
- Check that the bot is online and connected
- Use `/force_sync` to resync slash commands
- Ensure slash commands are synced (may take up to 1 hour)

**"Unknown User" in RSVP lists:**
- Bot needs "View Members" permission
- Users may have left the server or blocked the bot
- Bot will try to fetch user info from Discord API as fallback

**Reminders not sending:**
- Check reminder settings with `/configure_reminders`
- Verify event time is set with `/set_event_time`
- Ensure event channel is configured
- Check bot has permissions to send messages in event channel

**Setup already in progress:**
- If you get this error, wait for the current setup to complete or restart the bot
